# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends (cases, deaths, and vaccinations) across Belgium, Kenya, Burkina Faso, and Singapore. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis (EDA), and interactive visualizations to compare pandemic responses and outcomes.

##  Project Objectives

- Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data from Our World in Data
- Compare case trends, death rates, and vaccination progress across selected countries
- Generate visualizations (line charts, bar plots) to highlight key trends
- Extract data-driven insights on pandemic responses and disparities

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Primary language)
- Pandas (Data cleaning & analysis)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive reporting)

## How to Run/View the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
2. Download the dataset:
   Get owid-covid-data.csv and save it in /data.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook week 8 assignment.ipynb
4. Explore the analysis

## Key insights and reflections
- Belgium had the highest cases/deaths but strong healthcare.
- Singapore controlled outbreaks best (lowest death rate).
- Data limitations: Underreporting likely in Kenya/Burkina Faso.
- Global lessons: Vaccine access disparities need addressing.
